# Hello there!

This is a bunch of examples of mediapipe tricks that I've used to build interactive
applications using your face and hands.

It was designed to be hosted on glitch, but glitch is dead now (RIP). I do some weird things here - in particular, a lot of dependencies are embedded in funny ways to make them play nicely with glitch. If you were doing this the "normal" way you'd just install your dependencies via NPM or whatever.

But anyway the point here is some common mediapipe techniques.

There's not much documentation here - I apologize - since this repo is meant to be paired with a 3 hour workshop that I give live. But maybe some of the examples are still helpful to you.

The relevant stuff is:

- `boilerplate.js` - stuff you have to do basically every time you use mediapipe that isn't super interesting
- `utilities.js` - utilities I've made to make it nicer to interact with mediapipe
- `examples` - the good stuff! Examples of some techniques I find useful when working with mediapipe.

~You can also "remix" this directly on glitch if you have an account and edit the files yourself! Either in the browser (just click on a file and change it) or, if you prefer to work locally, you can pull down the files by hitting `Tools` at the bottom and choosing one of the export options.~
