# Hello there!

This is a bunch of examples of mediapipe tricks that I've used to build interactive
applications using your face and hands.

The relevant stuff is:

- `boilerplate.js` - stuff you have to do basically every time you use mediapipe that isn't super interesting
- `utilities.js` - utilities I've made to make it nicer to interact with mediapipe
- `examples` - the good stuff! Examples of some techniques I find useful when working with mediapipe.

If you want to play around with the examples, hit the "preview" button at the bottom of the screen and hit "open in new pane."

You can also "remix" this directly on glitch if you have an account and edit the files yourself! Either in the browser (just click on a file and change it) or, if you prefer to work locally, you can pull down the files by hitting `Tools` at the bottom and choosing one of the export options.

Sorry, I don't have time to write more right now. Hope you're enjoying the workshop.
