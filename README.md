# Hello there!

This is a bunch of examples of mediapipe tricks that I've used to build interactive
applications using your face and hands.

The relevant stuff is:

- `boilerplate.js` - stuff you have to do basically every time you use mediapipe that isn't super interesting
- `utilities.js` - utilities I've made to make it nicer to interact with mediapipe
- `examples` - the good stuff! Examples of some techniques I find useful when working with mediapipe.

Sorry, I don't have time to write more right now. Hope you're enjoying the workshop.
